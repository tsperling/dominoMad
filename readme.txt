Another old Blitz project now on git for anyone to access/modify as they see fit. Game has some bugs in it; I originally ran out of time while trying to finish it.

AIM OF GAME
--

The aim of the game is, quite simply, to get the highest score possible by building continuos chains of dominoes.

Once built, before moving to the next level, you will be given the option of pushing the dominoes over or leaving them standing. If you leave them, and manage to complete the next level's domino chain, your bonus will increase.

However, various hazards populate each level - carelessly (or maliciously) knocking and kicking your domino chain over. Should the final domino in a chain be knocked over, or accidentally picked up, domino man will lose a life, and any chains built in previous levels will topple, losing whatever bonus has been accumulated.

HOW TO PLAY
--

The domino man is controlled with the cursor keys.

--
OPTIONS
--

The options menu allows players to customise the controls to their preference.

The domino man can be moved with either the keyboard, or by mouse.

TOGGLE MODE

Toggle mode gives players the option of pressing the action key, and switching between 'picking up dominoes' and 'placing dominoes'.

GAME SPEED

The speed of the game can be altered. 100% is the normal rate of play, 50% is half speed.

CHANGES MADE TO REMAKE
--

The essence of the game remains identical to its original version.

Graphically, every sprite has been redrawn at at least double the resolution.

The most substantial change is the inclusion of physics, governing the movement of the dominoes themselves. Rather than follow a scripted toppling procedure, dominoes can now be knocked over and collide with each other dynamically.

Domino Man gave players one point for every millisecond they 'push' enemies around. Domino Mad does not.
